# Movix: Explore Movies and TV Shows with React

🎬 Introducing Movix: a React-powered website I'm thrilled to share with you all! 🚀

## Overview

🌟 With a blend of React, Redux, and SCSS, I've crafted an immersive platform to explore your favorite Movies and TV Shows. From the vibrant homepage to the detailed Movie/TV Show pages, every corner of Movix exudes the magic of cinema.

## Homepage

🏠 The homepage kicks off with a sleek banner and a search bar, followed by trending sections. Toggle buttons make sorting a breeze – choose between day and week for Trending, and between Movies and TV Shows for What's Popular and Top Rated. All this comes to a delightful close with an eye-catching footer.

## Navigation

🍿 The Navbar is your gateway to the magic. "Movies" and "TV Shows" lead to an exploration wonderland, where genres and sorting options abound. Infinite scroll ensures an uninterrupted browsing experience, with movie cards displaying key info like title, rating, launch date, and genre.

🔍 Seek out specific Movies or TV Shows with the search icon – results appear with the same seamless infinite scroll, enhancing your journey.

## Movie/TV Show Detail Page

🎞 Dive deeper into any chosen title, and the Movie/TV Show detail page unfolds before you. From the title and release year to tagline, genre, and rating, every facet is showcased. The animated trailer button beckons, followed by an overview, status, release date, runtime, director, and writers.

👥 The Top Cast section introduces the stellar performers, complete with images and character names. Official Videos offer glimpses of the movie's magic. And don't miss the Similar Movies and Recommendations sections – cinematic adventures await!
